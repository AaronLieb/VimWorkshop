/* Welcome to part 2 - Manipulating Text
 * 
 * Previously, we only used NORMAL mode. 
 *
 * Theres plenty of other keybinds that can modify text in NORMAL mode.
 * But, lets try using INSERT mode first.
 *
 * You can enter INSERT mode in a few ways.
 * "i" will put you into insert mode right before the cursor
 * "a" will put you into insert mode right after the cursor
 *
 * While in insert mode, you can type anything you'd like!
 * You can also use backspace in this mode to delete text
 * Once you're done, you can press <ESC> to go back to NORMAL mode
 *
 * Here is a sentence, but i merd sum sperling mistakes, try to fix them!
 *
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * You can also use "o" to enter INSERT mode on a new line
 *
 * Use "o" to put the word "Patty" between both buns
 *
 * Bun
 * Bun
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Since we'll be modifying stuff a lot, its important to know that
 * "u" will undo a
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  You can delete one character at a time using "x" while in NORMAL mode
 *
 *  Delete all of the 8s in this line:
 *
 *  The quick8 brow8n fox 8 ju8mped over 8the laz8y dog
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * You can use "d" to delete things longer than 1 character in NORMAL mode
 *
 * dw = delete word
 * d3j = delete 3 lines
 * dd = delete line
 *
 *  A vegetarian comes into a restaurant and wants their sandwich with no meat
 *
 *  Delete the meat using "dd"
 *
 *  Bun
 *  Lettuce
 *  Tomato
 *  Meat
 *  Bun
 *
 *  Use "dw" to delete a few words
 *
 *  delete me and me and me also me
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  You can "clear" things using "c" in NORMAL mode
 *  its the same as "d" except it puts you into INSERT mode after
 *
 *  "ciw" is one of the most useful combos, it stands for "clear inside word"
 *
 *  Try renaming this variable to something else using ciw
 *
 *  int measurement = 5;
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  You can copy text using "y"
 *
 *  yw to copy a word
 *  yy to copy a whole line
 *
 *  you can paste text using "p"
 *
 *  Someone really likes pickles on their sandwiches
 *  Try copy pasting more pickles into their sandwich!
 *
 *  Bun
 *  Pickles
 *  Meat
 *  Bun
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Theres more things but i ran out of time making this so we are done
 *
 * Good job!
